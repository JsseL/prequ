Pip Requ
========

A set of command line tools to help you keep your `pip`-based packages fresh,
even when you've pinned them.  [You do pin them, right?][0]

Pip Requ is a fork of [pip-tools][1] by Vincent Driessen.

Installation
============

```console
$ pip install --upgrade pip  # Pip Requ needs pip==6.1 or higher (!)
$ pip install pip-requ
```


Example usage for `pip-requ compile`
====================================

Suppose you have a Flask project, and want to pin it for production.  Write the
following line to a file:

    # requirements.in
    Flask

Now, run `pip-requ compile requirements.in`:

```console
$ pip-requ compile requirements.in
#
# This file is autogenerated by pip-requ compile
# Make changes in requirements.in, then run this to update:
#
#    pip-requ compile requirements.in
#
flask==0.10.1
itsdangerous==0.24        # via flask
jinja2==2.7.3             # via flask
markupsafe==0.23          # via jinja2
werkzeug==0.10.4          # via flask
```

And it will produce your `requirements.txt`, with all the Flask dependencies
(and all underlying dependencies) pinned.  Put this file under version control
as well.

To update all packages, periodically re-run `pip-requ compile --upgrade`.

To update a specific package to the latest or a specific version use the `--upgrade-package` or `-P` flag:

```console
$ pip-requ compile --upgrade-package flask  # only update the flask package
$ pip-requ compile --upgrade-package flask --upgrade-package requests  # update both the flask and requests packages
$ pip-requ compile -P flask -P requests==2.0.0  # update the flask package to the latest, and requests to v2.0.0
```

Example usage for `pip-requ sync`
=================================

Now that you have a `requirements.txt`, you can use `pip-requ sync` to update your
virtual env to reflect exactly what's in there.  Note: this will
install/upgrade/uninstall everything necessary to match the `requirements.txt`
contents.

```console
$ pip-requ sync
Uninstalling flake8-2.4.1:
  Successfully uninstalled flake8-2.4.1
Collecting click==4.1
  Downloading click-4.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl (62kB)
    100% |████████████████████████████████| 65kB 1.8MB/s
  Found existing installation: click 4.0
    Uninstalling click-4.0:
      Successfully uninstalled click-4.0
Successfully installed click-4.1
```

To sync multiple `*.txt` dependency lists, just pass them in via command line arguments e.g.:
```shell
$ pip-requ sync dev-requirements.txt requirements.txt
```
Passing in empty arguments would cause it to default to `requirements.txt`.
